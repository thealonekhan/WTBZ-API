# Zumhicache API

## Introduction
The Zumhicaching API is designed to give developers access to Zumhicaching.com data and enhance the Zumhicaching community experience. The API uses a RESTful approach and json data to make consuming the service simple and familiar. Partners who are accepted into the API program will receive a test and live token. The test token will allow our partners to play with the API without affecting live data. Once comfortable moving forward to live data, you may request a live token. You will need to provide access to your application to Zumhicaching HQ so that we may review it before receiving a live token.

As an API partner:

* We hope you create an application that is useful, inspiring and benefits the Zumhicaching community.
* You may not create an application that merely replicates or competes with the Zumhicaching HQ core services.
* You must respect Zumhicaching users and their privacy choices.
* You must comply with Zumhicaching HQ's Branding Guidelines and use the provided Zumhicaching logos and links where you use Zumhicaching HQ data and services in your application.
* Your application must comply with the Zumhicaching API Agreement, Zumhicaching Service Terms, your privacy policy and all applicable laws.
