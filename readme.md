# GeoCache By Zuhmi API

## Introduction
The Geocaching API is designed to give developers access to Geocaching.com data and enhance the geocaching community experience. The API uses a RESTful approach and json data to make consuming the service simple and familiar. Partners who are accepted into the API program will receive a test and live token. The test token will allow our partners to play with the API without affecting live data. Once comfortable moving forward to live data, you may request a live token. You will need to provide access to your application to Geocaching HQ so that we may review it before receiving a live token.

As an API partner:

* We hope you create an application that is useful, inspiring and benefits the geocaching community.
* You may not create an application that merely replicates or competes with the Geocaching HQ core services.
* You must respect geocaching users and their privacy choices.
* You must comply with Geocaching HQ's Branding Guidelines and use the provided Geocaching logos and links where you use Geocaching HQ data and services in your application.
* Your application must comply with the Geocaching API Agreement, Geocaching Service Terms, your privacy policy and all applicable laws.
